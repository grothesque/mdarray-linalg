# Experimental linear algebra bindings for Rust mdarray

This is the begin of an effort to add linear algebra bindings (BLAS, LAPACK, etc.) to the Rust [mdarray](https://github.com/fre-hu/mdarray) crate.
This library is not intended to be ever published on crates.io.
Rather, if the experiment is successful, the experience gained here will be used in creating real binding crates.

## Usage
```
cargo add --git https://git.grothesque.org/mdarray-linalg-prototype
```
You may also use the [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/grothesque/mdarray-linalg-prototype).

See the tests for usage examples.
